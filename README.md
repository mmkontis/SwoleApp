# Welcome to your Body Coach AI App ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) for a Body Coach AI application.

## About the App

The Body Coach AI app allows users to:
- Post daily topless body pictures
- Receive AI analysis of their physique
- Get a score based on the AI's assessment

This innovative app helps users track their fitness progress and provides valuable feedback through advanced AI technology.

## App Structure

The app features a tab-based navigation with three main sections:

1. Scan (First Tab): Upload daily photos for AI analysis
2. Goals (Second Tab): Set and track fitness goals
3. Coach (Third Tab): Chat with an AI coach for personalized advice

   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Features
